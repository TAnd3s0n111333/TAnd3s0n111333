👋 Hi, I’m Toby Anderson

I’m an undergraduate Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering (AI specialisation) and Physics student at Monash University, focused on autonomous systems, long-lived robotics, and the application of AI to extreme and uncertain environments.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Autonomous planning and decision-making

- Modular robotic systems

- Constraint-based system design

- Simulation-driven engineering

- Space, infrastructure, and resilience-focused technologies

I am particularly interested in how complex engineering knowledge can be formalised, preserved, and operationalised by autonomous systems over long time horizons.

🔬 Current Focus
Standard Template Construct (STC)

I am developing a long-term research project exploring how autonomous systems can reason about missions, environments, resources, constraints, and objectives to synthesise viable infrastructure and operational plans.

STC is a research framework — not a product — investigating:

- Constraint-based planning and validation

- Separation of planning, solving, and optimisation layers

- Modular representations of environments, agents, and systems

- Trade-offs between human labour, robotics, and automation

- Robustness and maintainability in long-lived autonomous systems

This work is intentionally slow, methodical, and research-driven.

🤖 Robotics & Autonomous Systems

Alongside STC, I work on robotics projects involving:

- Autonomous mapping and planning

- ROS2-based robotic software

- Simulation environments for planetary and extreme terrains

- AI-assisted decision-making systems

I am currently a contributor to Nova Rover, where I work with ROS2 to design and test robotic autonomy.

🧠 Technical Interests

- Autonomous planning & optimisation

- Artificial intelligence for decision-making

- Embedded systems and robotics

- Simulation and digital twins

- Space systems and planetary exploration

- Smart infrastructure and resilient systems

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming & Software

- Python, C++

- ROS2

- Git, Linux

- Basic ML pipelines

Hardware & Embedded

- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Jetson

- Sensors, actuators, control systems

- Embedded system integration

Engineering & Analysis

- Constraint modelling

- System architecture design

- Simulation-based validation

- Data analysis and visualisation

🎓 Background

- E3007 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science (Monash University), specializing in mechatronics engineering and astrophysics

I plan to pursue advanced study in robotics and physics, with long-term interests in autonomous infrastructure, space systems, and experimental engineering research.

🌍 Broader Vision

I am motivated by the belief that advanced autonomous systems can:

- Extend human capability into hostile environments

- Improve the resilience and sustainability of infrastructure

- Preserve and operationalise engineering, scientific, and cultural knowledge over generations

Much of my work explores these themes through practical engineering and long-horizon research projects.

📌 Note

Most repositories here represent research prototypes, simulations, or exploratory systems rather than finished products. I prioritise correctness, clarity, and architectural soundness over speed.
